    <p>Easter is a a time where families gather together to have fun and
      celebrate. There are a lot of fun things to do, like easter egg hunts,
      eating a lot of food, and getting to see all of your family from all
      over. In easter egg hunts, you get to collect a lot of colorful eggs,
      filled with treats like candy or money. The night before Easter, the
      Easter Bunny comes to visit children, and they get baskets full of
      chocolate and other gifts. On Easter, there is usually a lot of food to
      eat, like turkey, ham, potatoes, green beans, and more. Getting to see
      your family is always so fun. When you haven't seen them in a long time it
      is nice to catch up with them, especially if they live far away to hear
      about their city. </p>
